This is the **community recipe registry** for [sparkrun](https://github.com/spark-arena/sparkrun). Anyone can submit a
recipe via pull request and make it available to every sparkrun user.

Community recipes are run with the `@community` prefix:

```bash
sparkrun run @community/my-awesome-recipe
```

## Submit a Recipe

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Create** your recipe YAML in `recipes/`:
   ```
   recipes/
     my-model-vllm/
       recipe.yaml
   ```
3. **Open a pull request** — describe what the recipe runs, which runtime it targets, and expected VRAM usage
4. Once merged, your recipe is live for everyone

### Recipe format

Recipes follow the standard sparkrun recipe schema. See
the [recipe authoring docs](https://sparkrun.dev/recipes/overview/) for the full specification.

## Run Community Recipes

```bash
# List available community recipes
sparkrun list @community

# Run a community recipe
sparkrun run @community/my-awesome-recipe

# Check VRAM requirements before launching
sparkrun show @community/my-awesome-recipe
```

## Benchmark Your Recipes

Got a recipe that screams? Prove it.

Submit your recipe benchmark to [Spark Arena](https://spark-arena.com) to benchmark your recipes and see how they stack up. Publish your numbers and show the community what DGX Spark can do.

```
# Login to Spark Arena (if not already logged in) -- see https://spark-arena.com for details
sparkrun arena login

# Benchmark your recipes (this will run the recipe and upload the result to Spark Arena in one step)
sparkrun arena benchmark @community/my-awesome-recipe
```

Then you can go to https://spark-arena.com/leaderboard to see how you stack up!
